== Docker CLI Jenkins Agents

It contains Java / Git / Make / Docker CLI / Docker Compose CLI / GCR Credentials Helper / ECR Credentials Helper.

== Purpose

The purpose of that image is to be used as a Jenkins agent while being able to run docker command against a remote docker host. In Kubernetes, the docker host can simply be a side container in the Kubernetes Pod Agent.

=== Usage

=== Usage as a Jenkins agent

In Jenkins with the Kubernetes plugin, a pod with a `dind` side container can be used and the variable `DOCKER_HOST` can be set in both `jnlp` and `dind` container so that `jnlp` run commands against the daemon in the `dind` container. There is need to switch container in a pJenkins pipeline to use docker:

```yaml
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "Pod"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: "dind"
    # docker:20.10.6-dind-rootless
    image: "docker@sha256:bfc2af39af70d97b9e4231204d16445c1a584dd71067128503da5b8e96f42e65"
    env:
    - name: DOCKER_HOST
      value: tcp://127.0.0.1:2375
    - name: DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR
      value: ""
    lifecycle:
      postStart:
        exec:
          command: ["/bin/sh","-c",'while (! docker version > /dev/null 2>&1); do echo "Waiting for Docker to launch..." && sleep 1; done']
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 1000
      runAsGroup: 1000
      privileged: true
    tty: true
    volumeMounts:
    - name: docker-graph-storage
      mountPath: /var/lib/docker
  - name: "jnlp"
    image: "dohbedoh/jnlp-dockercli-agent:debian-jdk11"
    env:
    - name: DOCKER_HOST
      value: tcp://127.0.0.1:2375
    imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
    tty: true
    volumeMounts:
    - name: dshm
      mountPath: /dev/shm
  volumes:
  - name: docker-graph-storage
    emptyDir: {}
  - name: dshm
    emptyDir:
      medium: Memory
```
